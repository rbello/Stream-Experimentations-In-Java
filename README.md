# Stream Experimentations in Java

This project brings together my various experiments with the Java Stream API. The code is [here](https://github.com/rbello/Stream-Experimentations-In-Java/blob/master/src/streams/java/Main.java).
The various functions of this playground manipulate a data set containing different information about the cinema movies releases.
